# xDrip  
  
Welcome to the xDrip documentation.  

xDrip is an open-source Android app (compatible with Android 7–16) that turns your phone into a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. It is [developed and maintained](https://github.com/NightscoutFoundation/xDrip) by volunteers from the diabetes community.    
![xDrip main screen](./docs/images/xDinaction.png)  
  
It lets you customize your alerts, follow (monitor) your child, parent or partner, perform statistical analysis, set targets, control and interact with different CGM devices, and a lot more.  
There is no financial incentive for any of the xDrip developers.  Each one of us either has diabetes or has a loved one who does.  We need and use xDrip ourselves.

Documentation, instructions and guides here are provided to help you use xDrip.  
You need the advice of a competent medical professional to control your, or your loved one's, diabetes. This site provides no medical advice.
